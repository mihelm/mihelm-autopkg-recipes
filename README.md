# What's this?

These are my recipes for [AutoPkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg), geared towards use with [FileWave](https://github.com/autopkg/filewave).

I wrote none of these recipes from scratch. Most are based on recipes written by others, adapted to either work with a different application, or to work slightly differently. Often they do little more than import the output of a preexisting recipe into FileWave.

They rely on parent recipes from a wide range of repositories available in AutoPkg. On the first run it's advisable to run these recipes from the command line until all dependencies are sorted out. In each case the reference to the parent recipe should make it relatively straightforward to determine the required repo.

Afterwards it might be more convenient to use [AutoPkgr](https://github.com/lindegroup/autopkgr).

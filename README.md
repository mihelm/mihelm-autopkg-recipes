# What's this?

These are my recipes for [AutoPkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg), geared towards use with [FileWave](https://github.com/autopkg/filewave).

I wrote none of these recipes from scratch. Most are based on recipes written by others, adapted to either work with a different application, or to work slightly differently.

They rely on parent recipes from a wide range of repositories available in AutoPkg. It's advisable to run them from the command line the first time until all dependencies are sorted out. In most cases it should be pretty straightforward to figure out which repo needs to be added.

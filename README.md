# What's this?

These are my recipes for [AutoPkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg), geared towards use with [FileWave](https://github.com/autopkg/filewave).

I wrote none of these recipes from scratch. Most are copies of recipes written by others, adapted to either work with a different application, or to work slightly differently.

They rely on parent recipes from a wide range of repositories available in AutoPkg.
